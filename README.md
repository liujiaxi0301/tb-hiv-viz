# tb-hiv-viz
This project presents an interactive dashboard for exploring global HIV/TB co-infection prevalence, using non-routine WHO surveillance data. The dataset includes both Survey-based and Sentinel-based estimates, allowing users to examine differences in measurement approaches and regional patterns. A third option, Combined, selects Survey estimates when available and otherwise uses Sentinel data, representing the most up-to-date and complete snapshot for each country.

The dashboard features a world choropleth map and WHO region boxplots. Users can switch between data modes, hover to inspect country-level details, and click regions to highlight corresponding distributions. This design supports comparative analysis across countries, regions, and surveillance systems, enabling intuitive exploration of global disparities in HIV/TB co-infection burden.
